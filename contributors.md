### Financial supporters

SUCHO is grateful to the [Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH)](https://ach.org/) and the [European Association for Digital Humanities](https://eadh.org/) for emergency project grants.

We are also grateful to David Nu√±ez from MIT for connecting us with AWS, which has architected and runs our v2 infrastructure.

### The team

- Olha Aleksic, Ukrainian Research Institute, Harvard University

- Kristina Conroy, Ukrainian Research Institute, Harvard University
- Andy Janco, Haverford College
- Georgii Korotkov, Stanford University
