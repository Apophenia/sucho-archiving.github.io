# Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO)

We are a group of cultural heritage professionals – librarians, archivists, researchers, programmers – working together to identify and archive at-risk sites, digital content, and data in Ukrainian cultural heritage institutions while the country is under attack. We are using a combination of technologies to crawl and archive sites and content, including the [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), the [Browsertrix crawler](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) and the [ArchiveWeb.apge browser extension and app](https://archiveweb.page/) of the [Webrecorder project](https://webrecorder.net/). 


## How you can get involved
1. [Submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform) important URLs for collections in cultural heritage institutions in Ukraine
2. [Volunteer](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KbhtEOI8zKsQmKT_waE1XlYEF1E6t-HzJ7Gc1EBfMvMg_A/viewform) to help identify and archive sites and content, run technology (Browsertrix) or let us know if you are a Ukrainian researcher in need of secure storage for research or data files.
