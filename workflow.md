How we've organized things (as of March 1st).

## Acquiring and capturing links

- Links get submitted via the [Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online webform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform)
- Submitted links are world-viewable [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rf0sQ3OB7tirk1xKiaa52lzV9ZTCDkx7eiuK5EXj6l8/edit#gid=336731417)
- A couple times a day, admins go through that spreadsheet and copy new submissions into the [NeedsTriage tab of the SUCHO work spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kGScdU9df7T2QS9RnM_qvciT04Y1tmBiGVH-XD1E4l0/edit#gid=73136244)
- Volunteers can help triage:
  - If it's a whole site or collection, it should go to *Browsertrix*
  - If it needs to capture human interaction (e.g. complex Javascript things, virtual tours, etc.) it goes in *Webrecorder plugin*
  - If it's a few pages, or pages with PDFs and similar, it should go to *InternetArchive*
- Volunteers pick a task from any of the sheets, claim it, and either follow specific instructions in the spreadsheet (like for [Ukrainian National Library journals](/nbuv-journals)), or general instructions (like [using the WebRecorder browser plugin](webrecorder-plugin-instructions))
- When volunteers are done, they mark it as complete and fill in any info needed in the spreadsheet (e.g. links to Internet Archive bulk-capture spreadsheets)
- A couple times a day, admins go through the SUCHO work spreadsheet and move things that are done into the [Done tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kGScdU9df7T2QS9RnM_qvciT04Y1tmBiGVH-XD1E4l0/edit#gid=332157149)

## Volunteering

- Volunteers fill out the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KbhtEOI8zKsQmKT_waE1XlYEF1E6t-HzJ7Gc1EBfMvMg_A/viewform)
- A couple times a day, admins add new submissions from the volunteer form to the SUCHO Slack and the SUCHO work spreadsheet
- Admins welcome new members and check in with them about the kind of work they'd like to help with, directing them to the right Slack channel
- We have daily open orientation hours to help with getting started and troubleshooting; info goes in the #general channel

## Finding new links

There are multiple (probably at least partially-overlapping) web archiving efforts related to the invasion of Ukraine. SUCHO is focused on cultural heritage. Volunteers are welcome to look for additional links we should be capturing, and can use our list-of-lists, the [Guides to cultural heritage](https://www.sucho.org/cultural-heritage) page, as a starting point. For volunteers who can't read Ukrainian or Russian, the [Google Translate browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb/RK%3D2/RS%3DBBFW_pnWkPY0xPMYsAZI5xOgQEE-) can help give a sense of many sites. If it doesn't work, just move on to another site. Once you find a link, submit it through the [link submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform)
